AppSmell.js
==========

One day I realized that the source code for the chrome extension "[Chrome App Sniffer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/homgcnaoacgigpkkljjjekpignblkeae)" was availabe in the web inspector. Now, this isn't unusual, I suppose every extension is probably available in this way. So I set out to fool it.

After an hour or so this is where I was at. I didn't get them all, some of them would have taken a little more effort, and I didn't feel it was worth more than an hour of my time.

Then I found [Wappalyzer](https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer) and realized this project was a deep rabbit hole. Anybody who wants to jump in feel free.

I don't believe there's every anything to hide about which tools you used. I don't support that at all. This is just for giggles.
